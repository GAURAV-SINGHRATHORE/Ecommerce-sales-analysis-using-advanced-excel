# eCommerce Sales Analysis using Excel
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of eCommerce sales data to uncover key trends and insights. Using Advanced Excel techniques, I organized and processed large datasets, implementing functions such as VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, and PivotTables to efficiently analyze sales patterns. The project involved:

**Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized formats to ensure data integrity.

**Sales Trends Analysis**: Created dynamic charts and graphs to visualize monthly, quarterly, and yearly sales trends.

**Customer Segmentation**: Used formulas to categorize customers based on purchasing behavior and frequency.

**Performance Metrics**: Calculated key performance indicators (KPIs) like average order value, customer lifetime value, and return rates.

**Dashboard Creation**: Designed an interactive Excel dashboard to present the findings in an easily digestible format, allowing for real-time updates and analysis.

This project helped to identify top-selling products, peak sales periods, and potential areas for improvement, providing valuable insights for strategic decision-making.
